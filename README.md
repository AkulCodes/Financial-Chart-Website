# Financial-Chart-Website
Developed a web application to screen technical stock charts in Python 

To obtain a stockâ€™s candlestick chart and prices YFinance was used, and Ta-Lib was used for pattern recognition using stock prices inputted from a NumPy matrix. 

Used HTML to create an interactive user interface that allows users to search for candlestick charts, and hosted the web application on Flask.
